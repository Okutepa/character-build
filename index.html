        <h3 class="lb_heading">Huey Freeman</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
            "Maybe there are forces in this universe we don't understand. 
            But I still believe we make our own miracles."
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
            Huey is a highly intelligent 10-year-old boy, 
            who rarely smiles or laughs, and recognizes and detests the absurdities 
            (both obvious and perceived) of the society in which he lives. His cynicism 
            often touches upon subjects such as politics, religion, the media, businesses 
            and corporations, African-American culture, and American society as a whole.
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
            Tending to be obstinate in both manner and speech, Huey has demonstrated a 
            depth of understanding that would seem to surpass his young age, such as knowing 
            roughly what is going to happen in the future based on the actions and personalities 
            of the people involved. For example, in "The Fundraiser," Huey accurately predicts 
            what will become of Riley's candy-selling racket, going so far as to give him a bulletproof 
            vest that eventually saves his life. Huey has an amazing fighting style seen through his 
            fights with Riley and other characters throughout the series. Huey is the strongest out 
            of the group due to both his combat abilities and intellect.

          <h3 class="lb_heading">Riley Freeman</h3>
  
          <p class="lb_text">
            "You wanna be in this business, you got to pay the cost of doing business, 
            and when the cost gets too high, you get out of business."
          </p>
  
          <p class="lb_text">
            Riley is a highly impressionable third grader. He embraces the stereotypical 
            "gangsta" lifestyle, doing his best to promote the urban culture in the contrasting 
            suburb of Woodcrest. Influenced by the mass media via rap music and television, he 
            frequently uses poor grammar, and tends to defend his idols even when his imitations 
            go against common sense and righteousness.
          </p>
  
          <p class="lb_text">
            One example is his support of R. Kelly in "The Trial of R. Kelly", despite overwhelming 
            evidence proving Kelly's guilt, Riley believes he should not have to miss out on his next album 
            because of Kelly going to jail. This is further shown in "The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2" where 
            he dresses in effeminate clothing only because Gangstalicious created the style. He also refused to 
            believe that the rapper was gay despite the obvious clues to the contrary. In an effort to further 
            emulate the lifestyle he praises, he collects airsoft weapons and tags houses, as demonstrated in 
            "The Garden Party" and "Riley Wuz Here".
