        <h3 class="lb_heading">Huey Freeman</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          "Maybe there are forces in this universe we don't understand. But I
          still believe we make our own miracles."
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Huey is a highly intelligent 10-year-old boy, who rarely smiles or
          laughs, and recognizes and detests the absurdities (both obvious and
          perceived) of the society in which he lives. His cynicism often
          touches upon subjects such as politics, religion, the media,
          businesses and corporations, African-American culture, and American
          society as a whole.
          <br /><br />
          Tending to be obstinate in both manner and speech, Huey has
          demonstrated a depth of understanding that would seem to surpass his
          young age, such as knowing roughly what is going to happen in the
          future based on the actions and personalities of the people involved.
          For example, in "The Fundraiser," Huey accurately predicts what will
          become of Riley's candy-selling racket, going so far as to give him a
          bulletproof vest that eventually saves his life. Huey has an amazing
          fighting style seen through his fights with Riley and other characters
          throughout the series. Huey is the strongest out of the group due to
          both his combat abilities and intellect.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Riley Freeman</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          "You wanna be in this business, you got to pay the cost of doing
          business, and when the cost gets too high, you get out of business."
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Riley is a highly impressionable third grader. He embraces the
          stereotypical "gangsta" lifestyle, doing his best to promote the urban
          culture in the contrasting suburb of Woodcrest. Influenced by the mass
          media via rap music and television, he frequently uses poor grammar,
          and tends to defend his idols even when his imitations go against
          common sense and righteousness.
          <br /><br />
          One example is his support of R. Kelly in "The Trial of R. Kelly",
          despite overwhelming evidence proving Kelly's guilt, Riley believes he
          should not have to miss out on his next album because of Kelly going
          to jail. This is further shown in "The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2"
          where he dresses in effeminate clothing only because Gangstalicious
          created the style. He also refused to believe that the rapper was gay
          despite the obvious clues to the contrary. In an effort to further
          emulate the lifestyle he praises, he collects airsoft weapons and tags
          houses, as demonstrated in "The Garden Party" and "Riley Wuz Here".

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Robert Freeman</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          "Tough titty for him! He’s dead, and I’m going fishing!
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          The best way to describe Robert is that he is old yet unwise. He never
          accepts responsibility for his actions, nor does he learn any lessons.
          Robert has been shown to be extremely prideful, impatient and
          intolerant He believes in strict discipline, quick to go for his belt
          when the boys step out of line. As he says "I hate to see a child go
          unbeaten.
          <br /><br />
          He isn't exactly the best parental figure or influence. He is
          perfectly fine with sneaking into movies without paying. A dream
          sequence revealed that he is cowardly and quick to abandon friends and
          family to save himself. Robert describes himself as a "Civil Rights
          Legend.", though this title is often questioned by others throughout
          the series. When describing his experiences during those times he
          shamelessly includes himself alongside several important figures
          during that period. Quite frankly he earned more animosity from Black
          people then he did the Whites. He also says he's related to Jackie
          Robinson.

      <article>
        <h3 class="lb_heading">Uncle Ruckus</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">
          “A white doctor is 99.9% reliable. Black doctor is an oxymoron, unless
          it’s a witch doctor.”
        </p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Uncle Ruckus (no relation) is repellent in appearance, behavior, and
          attitude. He has an intense hatred of anything pertaining to black
          people, and goes out of his way to free himself from this identity.
          Ruckus claims God says the path to forgiveness for being black is to
          rebuke your own race.
          <br /><br />
          Ruckus champions the small traces of Native American, French, or Irish
          ancestry he claims to have (all of which are completely non existent),
          and wishes that all black people were still enslaved. He spouts white
          supremacist rhetoric and calls Michael Jackson (who suffered from the
          pigmentation disorder vitiligo) a "lucky bastard", as he no longer
          looks black. Uncle Ruckus claims that he is a Caucasian man who has
          revitiligo, to explain his own skin tone. In 1957, age about 18, he
          served on a jury in Tennessee, convicting a blind black man of murder.
          Perhaps Ruckus' most famous quote was “I’d shot you myself, but I
          realized the white men got better aim". In 1961, he was part of the
          violent opposition to the Freedom Rides.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Stinkmeaner</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">"What did you say, n***************"</p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Stinkmeaner is described as one of the most evil human beings to ever
          walk the earth. He is sadistic, nihilistic and overall horrible to
          everyone he meets. He enjoys the pain and anguish of other people.
          <br /><br />
          He claims to hate everyone in general (especially black people), but
          in truth, he simply loves being evil and hates anything even remotely
          innocent and peaceful, simply just finding being evil and bad just
          more fun and satisfying. He lived a long, terrible life, as when he
          got killed, he is sent to hell, where he literally felt truly much
          more happy than he ever had been in life and considers it much better
          than jail.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Thugnificent</h3>

        <p class="lb_text">"You just mad at all this thugnificence"</p>

        <p class="lb_text">
          Thugnificent, while kind and well-meaning, is loud, obnoxious,
          immature and blatantly rude for a man his age. He had made his success
          by being what can best called a "professional buffoon."
          <br /><br />
          As a rapper, Riley described him as a musical genius, only that he
          lacked the ability to read, write, or compose music. His songs, though
          popular when they came out, were limited to simple verses. When his
          popularity and career started to fail, it was his use of auto tune
          that sealed his doom. As a rapper and the only resident of Terra-Belle
          to achieve success, Thugnificent saw himself as being like royalty. He
          flaunted his wealth and lifestyle, taking pride in the hate and envy
          he gained. Thugnificent was also a horrible influence on children,
          foremost among them Riley.
